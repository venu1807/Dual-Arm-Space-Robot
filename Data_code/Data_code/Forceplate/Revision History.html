    <li>Added advanced functionality to control usb thread priority.</li>
	<li>Changes made to support control over the usb timeouts.</li>
	<li>Now supports plates that have calibration matrixes that include + signs as part of the data.</li>
    <li>Error logging in the %TEMP% folder now records more information which will assist in resolving device issues. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  Changes since October 28, 2009 to August 23, 2010 - build 300:
    <li>Removed Get/SetAcquirePortReadRate.</li>
	<li>Added ClearPollBuffer to discard current buffered data.</li>
	<li>Added GetZeroLevelNoiseValue for advanced filtering.</li>

	<li>CoP channel now uses a threshold value for better results.</li>
	<li>Better handling of USB errors.</li>
	<li>Updated to current chipset drivers.</li>
  <li>Improvements to data reading to reduce "lag" on slower systems, noticeably older laptops. </li>
  <li>No longer initializes devices twice.</li>

  <li>Improved the startup response time, no longer inits the devices twice on first start.</li>
  <li>New functionality: get last set buffer size.</li>
  <li>New functionality: set and get the low-level read size for fine control of device latency.</li>
  <li>New functionality: able to clear the poll buffer.</li>

  <li>Added support for more &quot;generic&quot; FTDI chipsets for wider range of device usage. </li>
  <li>Added support for new firmware that allows for CRC checksum.</li>
  <li>Devices are now always initialized on startup, instead of waiting for them.</li>
  <li>Error logging is done to a %TEMP%\bertecdevicelog.txt file. </li>
  <li>Multiple synchronized devices are now supported better. </li>
  <li>Corrected handling of plates that report more channels than actually exist.</li>
