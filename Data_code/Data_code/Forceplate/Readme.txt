This is the May 2014 release of the Bertec Device Driver package. You will need your current Bertec Device's USB driver installed in order to use this.

Included in this are the Bertec Device DLL file for use with programs that support "C" interfaces for DLLs, with example source code, a .NET interface for those that would prefer to use it along with .NET sample code, and a JAVA support dll with class library and example code. The .NET file comes with the documentation for the functions as an XML file for use with the .NET object browser, and the JAVA code comes with a generated javadoc folder.

In additional, there is complete SDK documentation in .PDF format.

Any comments, questions, or suggestions should be directed to Todd Wilson at todd@bertec.com
